# 🐮 SlaughterERP – Smart ERP System for Slaughterhouse Management

A scalable, microservices-based ERP system tailored to streamline slaughterhouse operations using Python, Django, MongoDB, Docker, and Kubernetes.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This ERP system is designed to help slaughterhouses manage daily operations — including production, inventory, procurement, and sales — in a modern, digital, and efficient way. With a modular microservices architecture, it enables better scalability, data management, and real-time processing.

## 💻 Tech Stack

| Technology | Logo | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Python / Django | 🐍 | Backend framework |
| MongoDB | 🍃 | NoSQL Database |
| Docker | 🐳 | Containerization |
| Kubernetes | ☸️ | Orchestration |
| Elasticsearch | 🔍 | Search engine |
| GraphQL | 🚀 | API query language |
| DRF (Django Rest Framework) | 🌐 | RESTful API layer |
| Celery + Redis | ⏱️ | Task Queue |
| Swagger / drf-yasg | 📘 | API documentation |

---

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|---|---|
| Handling complex data relationships across microservices. | We adopted a decoupled architecture using MongoDB + Elasticsearch for efficient indexing and querying. |
| Keeping APIs clean and standardized across all services. | Built a reusable CustomAPIView and CustomSerializer pattern shared across services. |

---

## 📈 Improvements and Optimizations

- **GraphQL Integration**: Added GraphQL alongside REST for more flexible and efficient data fetching.
- **Elasticsearch Indexing**: Introduced Elasticsearch indexing with signal handling for powerful and fast search capabilities.
- **Reusable Components**: Replaced boilerplate code with reusable base views and serializers to keep the code DRY.
- **Organized Swagger Decorators**: Implemented organized Swagger decorators for cleaner and more readable API documentation.
