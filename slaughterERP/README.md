# üêÆ SlaughterERP Service

The `slaughterERP` service is a core component of the Slaughterhouse ERP system. It manages fundamental data related to user accounts, product information, and ownership, providing a centralized source of truth for other microservices.

## üìñ Service Overview

This service is responsible for handling the master data of the entire system. It ensures that data for users, roles, products, and units is consistent and accessible to other services that need it. By centralizing this information, we avoid data duplication and maintain a single source of truth.
